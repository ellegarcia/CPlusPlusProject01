# CPlusPlusProject01
Project for OOP244

In this project, I built an application that enables waiters to take customer orders for food and drinks and generate a bill upon order completion. Each bill will have a unique number, and once an order is finalized, the bill will be saved in a separate file named according to its bill number.
